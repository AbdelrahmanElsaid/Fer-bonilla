<h2 align="center"> Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Fernando</h2>

<p align="center"> I am a Machine Learning and Deep Learning Engineer, working and experimenting with NLP models for text classification and analysis. Humor documents are a funny area for experiments, I am working on it! I am curious about Blockchain and Quantum computing, working and researching in some projects using Solidity for Ethereum and Hyperledger. </p>

### ðŸ’¼ Iâ€™m currently working on
- NLP fiel applied to documents classification! Funny jokes classifications and generation experiments!
- Doing progress with crypto-trading system using predictive models
- Building some Dapps with Solidity for petâ€™s care fundraising
- Designing some innovative services in the Govtech area, doing government digital services easier and cheaper.

### âš¡ I like to learn new things every day. I am interested in these areas:
-	Artificial Intelligence research oriented in the NLP field. Sentiment and humor detection are interesting areas.
-	Quantum computing applications for Machine Learning.
-	Blockchain Dapps and platforms.

### ðŸ‘¯ I want to collaborate 
with some nice project related to petâ€™s care, food waste and quality improvement, equality and inclusivity, and environment. If you know about something interesting, I have some time to work on it! 

### ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
I am not good with social media! But if you want to know something about my professional track please check my LinkedIn account. https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferbonillas/
